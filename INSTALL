PREREQUISITES

You need libopendmarc from Trusted Domain Project's opendmarc distribution.
You don't need the complete opendmarc package. Please check README and/or Changelog to verify
the version of the libopendmarc this module has been built with.
If your OS distro provides a libopendmarc package use that one, you'll also need
the -dev package for library headers, which are needed to build this module.
(E.g. on Ubuntu 12: libopendmarc1 AND libopendmarc-dev)
If your OS doesn't provide a package for libopendmarc, or you'd rather have your own build
follow these instructions:

- Download opendmarc-x.x.x-tar.gz from the project's Sourceforge area
- Extract the downloaded file in some directory (it will be normally named opendmarc-x.x.x)
- cd opendmarc-x.x.x
- ./configure --disable-filter [additional configure options if applicable, e.g. prefix=somewhere]
- make
- make check
- make install
This will install the libopendmarc libraries and includes "somewhere".

INSTALL

If the libopendmarc libraries and headers are in your system's default search paths just 
use the usual mantra:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install


If the libopendmarc libraries and headers are not in your system's default search paths,
or if you build your own libopendmarc, you need to know where the "somewhere" (see above) is, unless the "somewhere" is a standard location 
that Perl is be able to find without help.

In case it isn't kindly tell Makefile.PL where to locate the include and libraries using -L and INC:

perl Makefile.PL LIBS="-Lsomewhere/lib -lopendmarc -lresolv" INC="-Isomewhere/include"

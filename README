Mail-DMARC-opendmarc version 0.08
=================================

CAVEAT EMPTOR - Experimental code
	No production use track record.
	Use with caution.

This module provides a wrapper to Trusted Domain Project's libopendmarc
library. Its primary use is expected to be together the Mail::DMARC
module, but it can conceivably used standalone, if you really are
determined to do it.
The wrapper is rather thin.

Intended to (hopefully) become part of a slightly larger project providing DMARC support
for spamassasin.

Please refer to www.dmarc.org if you don't know what DMARC is,
if you are curious, interested, or willing to contribute to
its success.
